# Challenge
Given a string, output its longest [prefix]() which contains only digits.

## String Prefix
A **prefix** is a non-empty string constructed from the first few characters of the string.

For example, string `s = "abaca"` has five prefixes:
- `"a"`
- `"ab"`
- `"aba"`
- `"abac"`
- `"abaca"`

# Example
For `inputString = "123aa1"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = "123"`.

[prefix]: #string-prefix
