# Challenge
Given a string, find the shortest possible string which can be achieved by adding characters to the end of initial string to make it a [palindrome].

## Palindrome
A string that doesn't change when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).

**Examples:**
- `"eye"` is a palindrome
- `"noon"` is a palindrome
- `"decaf faced"` is a palindrome
- `"taco cat"` is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells `"tac ocat"`)
- `"racecars"` is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells `"sracecar"`)

# Example
For `st = "abcdc"`, the output should be `solution(st) = "abcdcba"`.

[palindrome]: #palindrome
