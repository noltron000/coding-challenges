# Challenge
Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

## Palindrome
A string that doesn't change when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).
- `"eye"` is a palindrome
- `"noon"` is a palindrome
- `"decaf faced"` is a palindrome
- `"taco cat"` is not a palindrome (backwards it spells "tac ocat")
- `"racecars"` is not a palindrome (backwards it spells "sracecar")

# Example
For `inputString = "aabb"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = true`.

We can rearrange `"aabb"` to make `"abba"`, which is a palindrome.
